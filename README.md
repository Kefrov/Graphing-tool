# Graphing-tool
A mathematical graphing tool that I made in 2 days using Python's Tkinter library. 
I'd really recommend this as a beginner project to most people.
I didn't bother converting main.py to an exe file.
This program utilizes the math library so functions like sin and cos work too. (e.g 'tan(z)')
